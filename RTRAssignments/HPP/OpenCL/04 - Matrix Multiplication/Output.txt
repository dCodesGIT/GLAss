1st matrix is from 0th element 0.001251 to 15th element 0.014985
2nd matrix is from 0th element 0.091403 to 15th element 0.663045
Multiplication of above 2 matrices creates 3rd matrix as :
3rd matrix is from 0th element 2142416479673467486493740080562176.000000 to 15th element 0.000000
Global work size = 256
